        <div class="terms-block">
          <h2 class="terms-h2">3. Timeline</h2>
          <p>We deliver the initial website and/or Venu setup within approximately 2 weeks of receiving all required materials from you (business details, content, photos, branding preferences, service list, and pricing). Complex projects or delays in receiving materials may extend this timeline. We will communicate any expected delays promptly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-block">
          <h2 class="terms-h2">4. Payment</h2>
          <p>The one-time setup fee is due in full before work begins. Payment is processed securely via Stripe. We do not store your payment card information.</p>
          <p>Monthly maintenance billing begins on the first of the month following your site's go-live date. Monthly payments are automatically charged via Stripe on the 1st of each month. Late payments may result in temporary suspension of services after 15 days past due.</p>
          <p>We do not charge transaction fees on payments processed through Venu or Venu+. Standard Stripe processing fees (currently 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction) are charged by Stripe directly and are deducted automatically from each transaction.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-block">
          <h2 class="terms-h2">5. What Monthly Maintenance Covers</h2>
          <p>Your monthly fee includes: website hosting and uptime monitoring, SSL certificate maintenance, up to 2 content update requests per month (text changes, image swaps, service or pricing updates), security updates and bug fixes, Venu/Venu+ platform access and SMS messaging (for applicable packages), and email support with response within 24 hours (Premium/Venu+) or 48 hours (Standard/Venu).</p>
          <p>Not included: redesigns, additional page builds, new feature development, photography, videography, copywriting beyond minor edits, or third-party software subscriptions. These are available at additional cost and will be quoted separately before work begins.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-block">
          <h2 class="terms-h2">6. Your Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>You agree to: provide all required business information, content, and materials in a timely manner; review and approve deliverables within 5 business days of submission (silence after 5 days constitutes approval); maintain an active Stripe account for payment processing (Venu/Venu+ packages); ensure that SMS messaging to your customers complies with applicable laws including obtaining proper consent; and notify us promptly of any changes to your business information, services, or pricing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-block">
          <h2 class="terms-h2">7. Ownership</h2>
          <p>All content you provide (text, photos, logos, branding) remains your property. The website code, design templates, and the Venu platform (including all software, architecture, and systems) remain the intellectual property of H4 Enterprise LLC. You receive a license to use these assets for the duration of your service. Upon termination, you retain your content but do not retain rights to the website code or Venu platform. Your domain name remains your property at all times, including after termination.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-block">
          <h2 class="terms-h2">8. Cancellation</h2>
          <p>You may cancel at any time with 30 days written notice to contact@h4services.co. The setup fee is non-refundable once work has begun. If we have not begun work, you may request a full refund of the setup fee within 7 days of payment. Monthly fees are due through the end of the 30-day notice period and are non-refundable for the current billing period.</p>
          <p>We may terminate with 30 days written notice, or immediately if payment is more than 30 days past due. We will make reasonable efforts to assist with transition.</p>
          <p>Upon termination, we will provide an export of your content and any customer or booking data within 14 days, remove the website from hosting within 30 days, and deactivate the Venu portal. Your domain remains yours and can be pointed to a new host at any time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-block">
          <h2 class="terms-h2">9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>Our total liability shall not exceed the total fees paid by you in the 3 months preceding a claim. We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages including lost revenue, lost profits, or business interruption. We are not responsible for downtime caused by third-party services (Stripe, Twilio, hosting providers, domain registrars, or internet service providers).</p>
